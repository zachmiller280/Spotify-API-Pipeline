# Data Visualization in Looker Studio

We now want to visualise our data and validate that we are getting the expected results. Google Looker Studio is a great option for a personal project, as it is free and reports are easily published and shared.

A sample export of my report can be found [here](https://github.com/zachmiller280/Spotify-API-Pipeline/blob/main/images/listening_stats.pdf)

## Google Looker Studio

First, we will need to add our database as a data source within Looker Studio.

### Adding your PostgreSQL DB as a Data Source
1. Navigate [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com) and follow the setup instructions. 
1. Click `Create` on the top left, then `Data Source`
1. Search for `PostgreSQL`
1. Enter the required credentials and click `Authenticate`
1. Select your table

You can now feel free to create some visualisations. Some tutorials/guides can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/studio?hl=en&visit_id=638759559392901347-1940849564&rd=1).
